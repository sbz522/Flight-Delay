# Flight Delays and Cancellations Data Visualization Project

This project uses a dataset obtained from Kaggle that contains information about the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015. The flights.csv file was used to create three visualizations in Tableau. The purpose of this project is to analyze and reveal insights about flight delays and cancellations.

# Visualizations
The three visualizations created for this project are:

   * Airlines with the highest number of delays and cancellations: This visualization displays the total number of delays and cancellations for each airline in the           dataset. The chart shows that the airlines with the highest number of delays and cancellations are American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United                         Airlines.

   * Destinations with the highest number of delays and cancellations: This visualization shows the destinations with the highest number of delays and                         cancellations. Chicago O'Hare International Airport(ORD), Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (ATL), and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW)       are the airports with the highest number of delays and cancellations.

   * Causes of delays: This visualization shows the reasons for flight delays, such as weather, carrier delay, late aircraft arrival, etc. The pie chart shows that the       most common reasons for delays are late aircraft arrival and departure delay.

# Conclusion
The visualizations created for this project show that American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines are the airlines with the highest number of delays and cancellations. Additionally, the airports with the highest number of delays and cancellations are Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD), Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport (ATL), and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). The most common reasons for delays are late aircraft arrival and departures delay.

This project demonstrates the importance of data visualization in analyzing large datasets and identifying trends and patterns. The visualizations created in this project can help airline companies and travelers make informed decisions about flight schedules and avoid delays.
